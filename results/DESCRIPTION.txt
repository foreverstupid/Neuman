This is a directory with graphical results. Subdirectories are named by the kernels and their parameters.
For example, 'exp_20_0' assigns to exponential kernels with parameters A=20, B=0.
Files in subdirectories are named by the count of nodes in segment [-20; 20].
Each graphic is a graphic of solutions: accurate - green, numerical - from blue to red, - and relative error.
The more graphics are red, the more count of interations was used for them calculating.
